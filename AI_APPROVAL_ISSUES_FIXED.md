# 🔧 AI Approval Issues - IDENTIFIED & FIXED

## **🎯 Issues Identified**

### **1. 500 Internal Server Error on Approval**
- **Problem**: Admin approval API was failing with 500 error
- **Root Cause**: Contestant points update was failing after submission status update
- **Result**: Submission showed as "approved" but contestant got no points

### **2. Points Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Database showed 10 points instead of 25 points from UI
- **Root Cause**: Approval process failed partially, only updating submission status
- **Result**: Inconsistent data between UI and database

### **3. Leaderboard Not Updating**
- **Problem**: Approved points weren't reflected on leaderboard
- **Root Cause**: Contestant points weren't updated due to failed approval process
- **Result**: Leaderboard showed outdated information
